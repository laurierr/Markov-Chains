now that i fell into your arms my only lover give out to give in i search for the capsule i lost  drag me to hell in the valley of the dalles like my mother give wings to a stone it’s only the shadow of a cross  i slept on my back in the shade of the meadowlark like a champion get drunk to get laid i take one more hit when you depart  i'll drive that stake through the center of my heart lonely vampire inhaling its fire i’m chasing the dragon too far  there’s blood on that blade fuck me i'm falling apart my assassin like casper the ghost there’s no shade in the shadow of the cross spirit of my silence i can hear you but i’m afraid to be near you and i don’t know where to begin and i don’t know where to begin  somewhere in the desert there’s a forest and an acre before us but i don’t know where to begin but i don’t know where to begin again i've lost my strength completely oh be near me tired old mare with the wind in your hair  amethyst and flowers on the table is it real or a fable well i suppose a friend is a friend and we all know how this will end  chimney swift that finds me be my keeper silhouette of the cedar what is that song you sing for the dead what is that song you sing for the dead i see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room well i got nothing to prove well i got nothing to prove  i forgive you mother i can hear you and i long to be near you but every road leads to an end yes every road leads to an end your apparition passes through me in the willows five red hens – you’ll never see us again you’ll never see us again i should have known better to see what i could see my black shroud holding down my feelings a pillar for my enemies  i should have wrote a letter and grieve what i happen to grieve my black shroud i never trust my feelings i waited for the remedy  when i was three three maybe four she left us at that video store be my rest be my fantasy i’m light as a feather i’m bright as the oregon breeze my black shroud frightened by my feelings i only wanna be a relief  no i’m not a gogetter the demon had a spell on me my black shroud captain of my feelings the only thing i wanna believe  when i was three and free to explore i saw her face on the back of the door be my rest be my fantasy i should have known better nothing can be changed the past is still the past the bridge to nowhere i should have wrote a letter explaining what i feel that empty feeling  don’t back down concentrate on seeing the breakers in the bar the neighbor’s greeting my brother had a daughter the beauty that she brings illumination  don’t back down there is nothing left the breakers in the bar no reason to live i’m a fool in the fetter rose of aaron’s beard where you can reach me  don’t back down nothing can be changed cantilever bridge the drunken sailor my brother had a daughter the beauty that she brings illumination shall we beat this or celebrate it you’re not the one to talk things through you checked your texts while i masturbated manelich i feel so used  found myself on spencer’s butte traced your shadow with my shoe empty outline changed my view now all of me thinks less of you  on the sheet i

lemon yoghurt remember i pulled at your shirt i dropped the ashtray on the floor i just wanted to be near you  emerald park wonders never cease the man who taught me to swim he couldn't quite say my first name like a father he led community water on my head and he called me “subaru” and now i want to be near you  since i was old enough to speak i've said it with alarm some part of me was lost in your sleeve where you hid your cigarettes no i’ll never forget i just want to be near you  still i pray to what i cannot see in the sprinkler i mark the evidence known from the start from the bed near your death and all the machines that made a mess far away the falcon flew now i want to be near you  what’s left is only bittersweet for the rest of my life admitting the best is behind me now i’m drunk and afraid wishing the world would go away what’s the point of singing songs if they’ll never even hear you the evil it spread like a fever ahead it was night when you died my firefly what could i have said to raise you from the dead oh could i be the sky on the fourth of july  well you do enough talk my little hawk why do you cry tell me what did you learn from the tillamook burn or the fourth of july we’re all gonna die  sitting at the bed with the halo at your head was it all a disguise like junior high where everything was fiction future and prediction now where am i my fading supply  did you get enough love my little dove why do you cry and i’m sorry i left but it was for the best though it never felt right my little versailles  the hospital asked should the body be cast before i say goodbye my star in the sky such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth do you find it all right my dragonfly  shall we look at the moon my little loon why do you cry make the most of your life while it is rife while it is light  well you do enough talk my little hawk why do you cry tell me what did you learn from the tillamook burn or the fourth of july we’re all gonna die the
