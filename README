Added an option to change the word length in the database, more words equals less randomness

random_sufjan.py
    calls MarkovChains.py, and lets you test the program out.

MarkovChains.py
    The actualy markov chain

carrie_and_lowell_lyrics.txt
    lyrics taken from Sufjan Stevens' Carrie and Lowell album.


I might add an option for 5 words, which would probably print all lyrics out in order
